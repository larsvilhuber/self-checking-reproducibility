# Confidential data

## TL;DR

- be able to separate the confidential data from other (to be made public) components
- all code must be available
- do not publish what you are not allowed to!

## Permissions

These will be noted in the **data use agreement (DUA), license, or non-disclosure agreement (NDA) that you signed or clicked through** to obtain access to the data from the data provider.

:::{warning}
Careful: scraped or downloaded data that did not have an explicit license!

### Keep in mind

Just because you (and the entire world) can **download the data** does **NOT** give you the (automatic) right to **re-publish** the data.

- Do NOT transfer or publish data that you have no rights to transfer. Always carefully read your data use agreement (DUA), license, or non-disclosure agreement (NDA) that you signed.
- Do NOT upload restricted-access data to the journal’s platform.
- DO structure the repository to take into the account the data that cannot be published.

## Communicating restrictions
Whatever restrictions are imposed on the data typically convey to other replicators as well. Document them in the public README, in the section about [“Data Availability and Provenance Statements.”](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/template-README.html#data-availability-and-provenance-statements)


## Organize your project so you can exclude confidential data
Consider a project with confidential and public-use data. Clearly separate the restricted from the open-access data, both in terms of the raw data as well as the processed data:

<pre> ```text README.pdf code/ main.do 01_data_prep.do 02_confidential_prep.do 03_analysis.do 04_figures.do data/ raw/ cps0001.dat confidential/ ssa.csv conf_analysis/ confidential_combined.dta ``` </pre>

## Strategy
When the replication package relies on confidential data that cannot be shared, or is shared under different conditions, you should

- Preserve (archive) the confidential replication package
  - If the data cannot be removed from a secure enclave, they should nevertheless be archived wherever the confidential data are kept5
- Prepare a confidential (partial) replication package project-confidential.zip, contains the contents of data/confidential and possibly data/conf_analysis.
- Prepare a non-confidential replication package that contains all code, and any data that is not subject to publication controls.

<pre> ```text README.pdf code/ main.do 01_data_prep.do 02_confidential_prep.do 03_analysis.do 04_figures.do data/ raw/ cps0001.dat confidential/ ssa.csv conf_analysis/ confidential_combined.dta ``` </pre>

**Important**: the package contains all code, including the code that is used to process the confidential data!

- Ensure that replicators have detailed instructions (README) on how to combine the two packages
- Specify which (if any) of the results in their paper can be reproduced without the confidential data.
