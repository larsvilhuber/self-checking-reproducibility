# Installing Docker on macOS

Newer Macs run on M chips, older ones on Intel chips. This may affect the ability to run most commonly used Docker containers, which are usually built for Linux on Intel. 

> This section is incomplete and untested.

- We have seen users report success running both types of containers using [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/). See [their note on Rosetta emulation](https://docs.orbstack.dev/docker/#intel-x86-emulation) for cross-platform compatibility.
- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/) can also be used.

> Note that both products may require you to purchase a license.
