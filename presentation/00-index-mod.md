# Introduction

This document describes a few **possible** steps to self-check replication packages before submitting them to a journal. It is not meant to be exhaustive, and it is not meant to be prescriptive. There are **many ways to construct** a replication package, and many more to check that it works.

## Computational Empathy
The key ingredient is what I call "**computational empathy**" - thinking about what an unknown person attempting to reproduce the results in your paper might face, **what they might know and assume**, and more importantly, **what they might not know** or know to assume. While the replication package might very well run on your computer, that is by no means evidence that it will run on someone else's computer. 

## Prerequisites {.smaller}

In what follows, we will assume that the replicator satisfies the following conditions:

::: {.incremental}

- they are familiar with their own **operating system** (not yours!)
- they are somewhat familiar with **how to run code** in the "dominant" programming language in your field (but...)
- they are **probably not  familiar** with cutting edge methods of running software that you might be using (but want to learn!)
- they likely have some experience with **how social scientists write code** and prepare data, but may not have your years of experience

## TL;DR

Techy lingo for "**too long, didn't read**". A summary of the most important takeaways will be at the top of each section.
