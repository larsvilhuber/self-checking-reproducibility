  Verifying yourself whether your replication package is reproducible is an important task. In this presentation and draft manual, I explore various methods, from very simple to very technical, how to improve the reproducibility of your packages. While focused on how you can check after the fact, many of these techniques can be incorporated into your workflow to ensure reproducibility from the start.
